##Data processing and statistical analysis code for Senior Thesis.


This code takes the congressional record as presented by Gentzkow, et al. (2018) and does my own preprocessing, and filtering, ultimately leading to a topic model which I use to formulate my dependent variable.


It is likely that this code is will need a bit of tweaking to get to run correctly on a different device, as this was all designed for only my personal use. However, I intend to periodically edit this to be more accessible.
