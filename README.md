Converting the Congressional Record to a topic model, and then creating regressions and tables from that data for analysis. 


This code takes the congressional record as presented by Gentzkow, et al. (2018) and does my own preprocessing, and filtering, ultimately leading to a topic model which I use as my dependent variable.


It is likely that this code needs a bit of tweaking to get to run correctly, as I have not edited it much after using it. However, I intend to come back to this in the future to make it more accessible, ideally just a few clicks to get it to run.
